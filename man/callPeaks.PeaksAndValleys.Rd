\title{Calls the peaks in peaks-and-valley estimates}

\description{
  Calls the peaks in peaks-and-valley estimates to a set of known state.
}

\usage{
\method{callPeaks}{PeaksAndValleys}(fit, expected=c(-1/2, -1/4, 0, +1/4, +1/2) * pi, flavor=c("decreasing", "all"), verbose=FALSE, ...)
}

\arguments{
 \item{fit}{A KxC \code{\link[base]{data.frame}} of peaks-and-valley estimates.}
 \item{expected}{The expected locations of the peaks to be called.}
 \item{flavor}{A \code{\link[base]{character}} string specifying what flavor of the
   caller to use.}
 \item{verbose}{A \code{\link[base]{logical}} or a \code{\link[R.utils]{Verbose}} object.}
 \item{...}{Not used.}
}

\value{
  Returns a Kx(C+2) \code{\link[base]{data.frame}}.
}

\section{Flavors}{
 If \code{flavor == "all"}, each peak is called to the state with the
 closest expected value.
 If \code{flavor == "decreasing"}, the strongest peak is called to the
 state with the closest expected value, then the second strongest peak
 is called analogously to one of the remaining states, and so on.
