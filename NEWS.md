## Miscellaneous

 * ROBUSTNESS: Package now does a better job importing objects from
   suggested packages.


# Version 1.5.8 (2014-09-04)

## Bug Fixes

 * It could be that `process()` for `AbstractCurveNormalization` would
   generate an error due to read-only permissions introduced by
   copying the target file without resetting the file permissions.

## Miscellaneous

 * Added a few missing NAMESPACE imports.
   

# Version 1.5.7 (2014-06-14)

## Miscellaneous

   mean-level estimators than the sample mean have been used.


# Version 1.3.0 (2013-01-07)

## Bug Fixes

 * `process()` for `PairedPscbsCaller` used the global `verbose`.

## Miscellaneous

 * Bumped up the package dependencies.


# Version 1.2.20 (2012-12-19)

## Bug Fixes

 * Some `example()` scripts used non-defined values.


# Version 1.2.19 (2012-11-26)

## Miscellaneous

 * Bumped up the package dependencies.


# Version 1.2.18 (2012-11-21)

# Version 1.2.15 (2012-11-05)

## Miscellaneous

 * CLEANUP: Replaced all `whichVector()` with `which()`, because the
   latter is now the fastest again.


# Version 1.2.14 (2012-11-01)

## Miscellaneous

 * ROBUSTNESS: Now package also imports **PSCBS** to please `R CMD check`.
   The reason was that some of the internal methods call **PSCBS**
   methods, which only happens if **PSCBS** is loaded in the first place
   but `R CMD check` cannot known that.


# Version 1.2.13 (2012-10-29)

## Miscellaneous

 * CLEANUP: Now using `Arguments$get{Read,Writ}ablePath()` instead of
   `filePath(..., expandLinks = "any")`.


# Version 1.2.12 (2012-10-21)

## Miscellaneous

 * ROBUSTNESS: Now using `Arguments$getWritablePath()` everywhere instead
   of `mkdirs()`, because the former will do a better job in creating
   and asserting directories on slow shared file systems, and when it
   fails it gives a more informative error message.


# Version 1.2.11 (2012-10-17)

## Miscellaneous

 * ROBUSTNESS: Now all static `Object` methods that calls "next" methods,
   utilizes `NextMethod()`, which became possible with **R.oo** v1.10.0.


# Version 1.2.10 (2012-10-16)

## Bug Fixes

 * ROBUSTNESS/BUG FIX: No longer passing `...` to `NextMethod()`, cf.
   R-devel thread 'Do *not* pass '...' to NextMethod() - it'll do it
   for you; missing documentation, a bug or just me?' on Oct 16, 2012.

   normal names don't match, e.g. `GSM517071_vs_GSM517072` (if match
   then just `Patient1`).  It also generated `pair` tags.

## Miscellaneous

 * Bumped up the package dependencies.

## Bug Fixes

 * `drawC1C2Density()` for `PairedPSCBS` would throw an exception if
   there was only one segment, or less than two finite (C1,C2):s.


# Version 1.0.3 (2012-02-24)

## Miscellaneous
 
 * Moved some internal functions to the **PSCBS** package, so package
   dependencies was also updated.

## Miscellaneous
 
 * Updated package dependencies.
 
 * Additional internal updates.


# Version 1.0.1 (2012-01-16)

## New Features

 * Added `TotalCnBinnedSmoothing()`.

## Miscellaneous
 
 * The **aroma.cn** v0.8.1 tarball uploaded to CRAN mistakenly
   contained a NAMESPACE file, which shouldn't have been there.


# Version 0.8.1 (2011-07-27)

## Bug Fixes

 * WORKAROUND: In order for the package to work with the most recent
   version of R devel, which automatically add namespaces to packages
   who do not have one, we explicitly have specify that this package
   should use `cat()` and `getOption()` of **R.utils** (instead of
   **base**).

   `callNaiveGenotypes()`, and internal `findPeaksAndValleys()`
   to **aroma.light** v1.5.3.


# Version 0.4.6 (2010-03-18)

## Bug Fixes

 * `getOutputDataSet()` of `AbstractCurveNormalization` returned all
   files, not just the ones matching the input set.


# Version 0.4.3 (2010-01-01)

## Miscellaneous

   and non-finite values.  They also censor outliers to become
   infinite/extreme values.
   
 * Added `callXXorXY()`.
 
 * Added an `example()` to the Rd help of `callNaiveGenotypes()`.
 
 * Added Rd help to `findPeaksAndValleys()`.

 * Renamed argument `alignByChromosome` for the constructor of the
   `MultiSourceCopyNumberNormalization` class to `align` in order to
   allow for more types of aligned.
   
 * The alignment of `MultiSourceCopyNumberNormalization` is now done
   using `normalizeDifferencesToAverage()`, which is robust against
   outliers, waviness, etc.  The previous method which normalized
   toward the same overall median is no longer available.

## New Features

 * Added `normalizeDifferencesToAverage()`.
 
## Bug Fixes

 * `getTags()` of `MultiSourceCopyNumberNormalization` would return
   all asterisk tags as merged, e.g. `c("mscn,align", "tagA",
   "tagB")`.


# Version 0.3.5 (2009-07-15)

## New Features

 * ADDED: `XYCurveNormalization` and `PrincipalCurveNormalization`.
 
## Bug Fixes

 * `TumorBoostNormalization`: the `srcFiles` attribute in file footer
   of the result files contained a duplicated default footer instead
   of the tumor-normal pair.


# Version 0.3.4 (2009-07-08)

## New Features

 * Added low-level `callNaiveGenotype()` and `normalizeTumorBoost()`.


# Version 0.3.3 (2009-07-02)

## New Features

   `"v2"` and homozygotes according to `"v1"`.
   
 * Added new model flavor (`"v3"`) of `TumorBoostNormalization` that
   is an extension of last weeks model flavor.


# Version 0.3.2 (2009-06-23)

## New Features

 * Added an optional flavor (`"v2"`) of `TumorBoostNormalization` that
   avoids over correcting (especially at the heterozygotes), but
   adjusting the correction factor.  Use argument `flavor = "v2"`.


# Version 0.3.1 (2009-06-08)

## Significant Changes

 * The constructor of `TumorBoostNormalization` now only takes an
   `AromaUnitGenotypeCallSet` for argument `gcN`.  It no longer takes
   an `AromaUnitFracBCnBinarySet` object, which was only an ad hoc
   solution.


# Version 0.3.0 (2009-05-29)
   
## New Features
   
 * Added argument `alignByChromosomes` to
   `MultiSourceCopyNumberNormalization`.  If TRUE, the signals are
   shifted per chromosome such that the mean of the normalized
   smoothed signals is the same for all sources.  This can for
   instance remove systematic effects on sex chromosomes added by some
   ad hoc preprocessing methods.
  
 * Added a `clearCache()` to `MultiSourceCopyNumberNormalization`.
 
 * ALPHA: Added `TumorBoostNormalization`.
 
 * INTERNAL: Added foundations for TumorBoost, i.e. in memory classes
   such as `TotalAndFracBSnpData`.
 
 * INTERNAL: Added `findPeaksAndValleys()`.

 * ROBUSTNESS: Now all constructors report on unknown arguments.
 
 * ROBUSTNESS: Now `MultiSourceCopyNumberNormalization` first write
   normalized data to a temporary file, which is then renamed. This
   lower the risk for having incomplete data in case of interrupts.
  
 * Now `getOutputDataSets()` of `MultiSourceCopyNumberNormalization`
   only returns output data files with a matching fullname in the
   input set.

## Bug Fixes

 * Added missing argument `verbose` in `getTargetPositions()` of
   `TotalCnSmoothing`.  This caused unwanted verbose output in some
   cases.
  
 * `process()` of `TotalCnSmoothing` would not "recognize" fullname
   translators, that is, the output filenames were always identical to
   the input ones.

## Miscellaneous

 * Package passes `R CMD check` and all redundancy tests.


# Version 0.2.2 (2009-02-23)

## Miscellaneous

 * Minor update in order to work with new `RawGenomicSignals`.

   annotation data fields to the returned object, e.g. platform,
   chipType, and the fullname of the source file.


# Version 0.1.3 (2008-05-28)

## New Features

 * ALPHA: Added `normalizePrincipalCurve()` and `fitPrincipalCurve()`.


# Version 0.1.2 (2008-05-22)

## New Features

 * ALPHA: Added `extractRawCopyNumbers()` to `AromaTotalCnBinaryFile`.
 
 * ALPHA: Added `TotalCnSmoothing`.


# Version 0.1.1 (2008-05-18)

## New Features

 * Package now provides platform-independent classes
   `Aroma{Total|FreqB}CnSignal{File|Set}`.   With the more generalized
   **aroma.core** package, it is now possible retrieve the `AromaUgpFile`
   for the above.  This provides the necessary basic methods for
   plotting data along chromosomes.


# Version 0.1.0 (2008-05-09)

 * Created.
