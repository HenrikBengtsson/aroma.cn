Package: aroma.cn
=================

Version: 0.5.0 [2010-05-14]
o Package submitted to CRAN.
o Updated citation information.
o Package now requires aroma.core v1.6.0.
o Package pass R CMD check on R v2.11.0 and v2.12.0 devel. 


Version: 0.4.7 [2010-04-04]
o Moved normalizeDifferencesToAverage(), normalizeTumorBoost(), 
  callNaiveGenotypes() and internal findPeaksAndValleys()
  to aroma.light v1.5.3.


Version: 0.4.6 [2010-03-18]
o BUG FIX: For flavors "v2" and "v3", normalizeTumorBoost() could
  introduce NaN:s if betaN was exactly zero or exactly one.


Version: 0.4.5 [2010-01-14]
o Added (for now internal) option to change the degrees of freedom
  of the fitted principal curves in MSCN.
o Added plotSmoothedPairsOne() to MultiSourceCopyNumberNormalization.


Version: 0.4.4 [2010-01-05]
o Added support for transform/untransform functions h(.) and g(.) to
  AbstractCurveNormalization, which allows us to fit say on the log
  scale, e.g. h(x)=log2(x), g(y)=2^y.
o BUG FIX: getOutputDataSet() of AbstractCurveNormalization returned 
  all files, not just the ones matching the input set.


Version: 0.4.3 [2010-01-01]
o ROBUSTNESS: Using new Arguments$getInstanceOf() were possible.
o ROBUSTNESS: Now all index arguments are validated correctly 
  using the new 'max' argument of Arguments$getIndices().  Before
  the case where "max == 0" was not handled correctly.  


Version: 0.4.2 [2009-12-09]
o Made flavor="v4" of TumorBoostNormalization the default, and if 
  used then no "flavor" tag is added.


Version: 0.4.1 [2009-11-03]
o Now callXXorXY() and callNaiveGenotypes() handles
  missing values and non-finite values.  They also
  censor outliers to become infinite/extreme values.
o Added callXXorXY().
o Added an example() to the Rd help of callNaiveGenotypes().
o Added Rd help to findPeaksAndValleys().
o Now argument 'tol' of findPeaksAndValleys() can be zero;
  before it had to be at least the smallest possible double.


Version: 0.4.0 [2009-11-01]
o CLEAN UP: Removed suggested dependency on princurve, which is
  now indirectly suggested/requested via aroma.light.
o More recent dependencies on Bioconductor packages.
o Package passes R CMD check on R v2.10.0.


Version: 0.3.8 [2009-10-10]
o Added normalizeTumorBoost() for RawAlleleBFractions.
o Added callGenotypes() for RawAlleleBFractions.
o Added RawGenotypeCalls. 


Version: 0.3.7 [2009-10-02]
o CLEAN UP: Updated to use byPath() instead fromFiles().


Version: 0.3.6 [2009-09-30]
o Renamed argument 'alignByChromosome' for the constructor of the
  MultiSourceCopyNumberNormalization class to "align" in order to
  allow for more types of aligned.
o UPDATE: The alignment of MultiSourceCopyNumberNormalization is now
  done using normalizeDifferencesToAverage(), which is robust against
  outliers and waviness etc.  The previous method which normalized
  toward the same overall median is no longer available.
o Added normalizeDifferencesToAverage().
o BUG FIX: getTags() of MultiSourceCopyNumberNormalization would return
  all asterisk tags as merged, e.g. c("mscn,align", "tagA", "tagB").


Version: 0.3.5 [2009-07-15]
o ADDED: XYCurveNormalization and PrincipalCurveNormalization.
o BUG FIX: TumorBoostNormalization: the 'srcFiles' attribute in file
  footer of the result files contained a duplicated default footer 
  instead of the tumor-normal pair.


Version: 0.3.4 [2009-07-08]
o ADDED: low-level callNaiveGenotype() and normalizeTumorBoost().


Version: 0.3.3 [2009-07-02]
o Added model 'flavor' "v4" which corrects heterozygots according 
  to "v2" and homozygotes according to "v1".
o Added new model flavor ("v3") of TumorBoostNormalization that is 
  an extension of last weeks model flavor.


Version: 0.3.2 [2009-06-23]
o Added an optional flavor ("v2") of TumorBoostNormalization that 
  avoids over correcting (especially at the heterozygotes), but 
  adjusting the correction factor.  Use argument flavor="v2".


Version: 0.3.1 [2009-06-08]
o UPDATE: The constructor of TumorBoostNormalization now only takes an
  AromaUnitGenotypeCallSet for argument 'gcN'.  It no longer takes an
  AromaUnitFracBCnBinarySet object, which was only an ad hoc solution.


Version: 0.3.0 [2009-05-29]
o ROBUSTNESS: Now all constructors report on unknown arguments.
o ROBUSTNESS: Now MultiSourceCopyNumberNormalization first write
  normalized data to a temporary file, which is then renamed. This
  lower the risk for having incomplete data in case of interrupts.
o Now getOutputDataSets() of  MultiSourceCopyNumberNormalization only
  returns output data files with a matching fullname in the input set.
o Added argument 'alignByChromosomes' to MultiSourceCopyNumberNormalization.
  If TRUE, the signals are shifted per chromosome such that the mean 
  of the normalized smoothed signals is the same for all sources.
  This can for instance remove systematic effects on sex chromosomes
  added by some ad hoc preprocessing methods.
o Added a clearCache() to MultiSourceCopyNumberNormalization.
o ALPHA: Added TumorBoostNormalization.
o INTERNAL: Added foundations for TumorBoost, i.e. in 
  memory classes such as TotalAndFracBSnpData.
o INTERNAL: Added findPeaksAndValleys().
o BUG FIX: Added missing argument 'verbose' in getTargetPositions() of
  TotalCnSmoothing.  This caused unwanted verbose output in some cases.
o BUG FIX: process() of TotalCnSmoothing would not "recognize" fullname
  translators, that is, the output filenames were always identical to 
  the input ones.
o Package pass R CMD check and all redundancy tests.


Version: 0.2.2 [2009-02-23]
o Minor update in order to work with new RawGenomicSignals.


Version: 0.2.1 [2009-02-12]
o Added redundancy tests to package.
o Further cleanup.  Some functions are now in aroma.light.


Version: 0.2.0 [2009-01-26]
o Adopted the package to the new classes of aroma.core.
o Several classes and methods were moved to aroma.core v1.0.0.
o {fit|backtransform}PrincipalCurve() were moved to aroma.light v1.11.1.


Version: 0.1.7 [2008-10-07]
o ALPHA: Added backtransformPrincipalCurve().


Version: 0.1.6 [2008-08-18]
o Added alpha version of MultiSourceCopyNumberNormalization.


Version: 0.1.5 [2008-07-30]
o Fixed some broken cross links in the Rd help.
  Package pass R CMD check on R v2.7.1 and v2.8.0.


Version: 0.1.4 [2008-06-12]
o Now extractRawCopyNumbers() of AromaTotalCnBinaryFile adds 
  annotation data fields to the returned object, e.g. platform, 
  chipType, and the fullname of the source file.


Version: 0.1.3 [2008-05-28]
o ALPHA: Added normalizePrincipalCurve() and fitPrincipalCurve().


Version: 0.1.2 [2008-05-22]
o ALPHA: Added extractRawCopyNumbers() to AromaTotalCnBinaryFile.
o ALPHA: Added TotalCnSmoothing.


Version: 0.1.1 [2008-05-18]
o Package now provides platform-independent classes 
  Aroma{Total|FreqB}CnSignal{File|Set}.   With the more generalized
  aroma.core package, it is now possible retrieve the AromaUgpFile
  for the above.  This provides the necessary basic methods for 
  plotting data along chromosomes.


Version: 0.1.0 [2008-05-09]
o Created.
